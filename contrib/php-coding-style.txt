PHP Coding Style Guide

General
Files MUST use only <?php tags, not <?, <%, etc.
For files containing only PHP code, the closing tag must always be omitted.
Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps.
Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.
Method names MUST be declared in camelCase.
Variable names MUST be declared in camelCase.
Variable names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Underscores are not permitted. Numbers are permitted in variable names but are discouraged in most cases.
Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.
There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120 characters; lines SHOULD be 80 characters or less.

--------------------

Filenames
For all other files, only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and the dash character ("-") are permitted. Spaces are strictly prohibited.
Any file that contains PHP code should end with the extension ".php". The following examples show acceptable filenames for Model3 classes:

Controller/IndeController.php
Model/Auth/Service.php

File names must map to class names as described above.

--------------------

Documentation Format
All documentation blocks ("docblocks") must be compatible with the phpDocumentor format.
Describing the phpDocumentor format is beyond the scope of this document.
